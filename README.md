# Project: End-to-End NLP Project: Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews

**Description:**
In this project, I delved into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by working on a sentiment analysis use case using Amazon reviews. The objective was to build a classifier capable of predicting whether a review expressed a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. Key tasks included data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.

**Key Features:**
1. Conducted data preprocessing and feature extraction on Amazon review datasets.
2. Built and evaluated a sentiment classifier using machine learning algorithms.

**Technologies Used:**
1. Python
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
3. Machine Learning
